# Application Development Framework examples

This repository contains a collection of examples of simple (and less simple) projects developed using the [Alfresco Application Developer Framework](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components). 

# Goal of the ADF examples

The goal of the repository is to provide working source code as an example, and some useful components to be used as inspiration for your use cases and custom applications.
The idea is to enable developers, sharing some best practices and useful tips to reduce the learning curve and the time to market of your artifacts.
We are committed to increase this collection of projects in number and complexity during the near future, to give you the a practical place where to find working examples to start (or experiment) your development.

# Introduction to the Alfresco ADF

Before downloading and trying to use the ADF examples, be sure you covered the basis of [Angular2](https://angular.io/) and [Alfresco Application Developer Framework](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components).
For an introduction to the Alfresco ADF, you can refer to the [Getting Started page](https://community.alfresco.com/community/application-development-framework/pages/get-started) of the [Alfresco Community Portal](https://community.alfresco.com/).

# About the structure of the repository

For a better understanding, the structure of the repository is organized by Alfresco ADF version.
Each example is organized as an independent project and named as much clear as possible, to introduce the main topic covered.
Each project contains at least a `README` file introducing the use case, the enviornment, the used versions and prerequisites in general.
Below an example of repository structure, representing the two levels: the Alfresco ADF version and the projects.
```
|-- adf-examples
    |-- ADF X.X.X
        |-- Project 1
        |-- Project 2
        |-- ...
    |-- ADF Y.Y.Y
        |-- Project 3
        |-- Project 4
        |-- ...
    |-- README.md
    |-- ...
```

# Improving the collection of examples
