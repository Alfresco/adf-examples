# Creating aps-signature-stencil-sample (ADF 1.5.0 example)

This project is part of the [Alfresco Application Developer Framework](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components) collection of examples.
For further details about the repository and all the available examples please check the [introduction](https://github.com/Alfresco/adf-examples).

## About this project

This project implements an [Alfresco ADF](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-ng2-components) application, starting process instances and viewing open tasks. Very specifically this example shows how to implement the signaturepad component mentioned in this [blog](https://community.alfresco.com/community/bpm/blog/2017/05/01/form-stencil-examples-alfresco-process-services-aps) in an ADF application. The implementation is using [angular2-signaturepad library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-signaturepad).

By its nature, the application interacts with Alfresco Process Services as BPM System.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, please check the assumptions listed below.

- Alfresco Process Services v1.6.0+ running on `localhost` on port `9999`. You can check [here](https://community.alfresco.com/docs/DOC-6614-installing-activiti-bpm-as-adf-service-layer) for further details on how to install and setup Alfresco Activiti as Alfresco ADF Service Layer. If you have Alfresco Process Services running on a port other than 9999, don't worry, there is a settings option using which you can change the url before logging into the web application.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) JavaScript runtime version 6.9+. Together with its package ecosystem named [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).


## Running the application

Once the prerequisites will be checked, follow the tasks below to run the application.

- Open a terminal and change the directory to be in the `aps-signature-stencil-sample` folder.

- Install dependencies executing the command below. The execution of this command will require some time to be completed. If some warnings will appear into the terminal, don't worry.

```sh
npm install
```

- Compile and run the application executing the command below. The command compiles and starts the project in watch mode. Upon start, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000` with your preferred browser. The browser will automatically reload upon changes to the source code.

```sh
npm start
```

- Log into the application using your Alfresco Process Services credentials and you should see any open tasks via "My Tasks" component. You should now also be able to start any processes that you have access via "Start New Process" tab/link in the ADF application.

- **Let's now test the signature component. In order to do that that please import the [Process Application](https://github.com/cijujoseph/activiti-examples/blob/master/stencil-samples/signature-pad-stencil/SignaturePad.zip) into your Alfresco Process Services and publish the application using the Alfresco Process Services UI. This step will deploy a couple of processes where the signaturepad component is utilized on both start and task forms using the "stencil" feature in Alfresco Process Services. Run these newly deployed process via this ADF app which will render those signaturepad components correctly.**
